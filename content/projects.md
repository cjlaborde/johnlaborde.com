## Projects

My main focus these days is creating applications or websites for businesses.
Business sites require a unique form of engineering.
1) They demand to be highly secure and bug-free sites & applications.
2) Sites need to be designed with the User mindset in mind. they have to be easy to use and as minimum mental overload for your clients to be accessible to all ages. In this modern world where attention is a premium. Having a badly designed site will servery reduce your ROI.
3) Test and measure every detail for constantly evolving to create a quality application.

#### Realastra
Application to operate an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities.  Build with laravel and vue. It includes a map search for lodgings based on room type, the number of people to accommodate, bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, price, and location using geospatial data. Users can book properties and be charged using stripe. Property owners can list their properties and receive their payment once a user books a property.
Users and property owners can manage their reservations in a custom build admin panel. Property owners can approve or decline reservations. Property owners can add discounts for certain dates. Reservations are concurrency-safe to not allow duplicate reservations at conflicts dates same time when both users submit a reservation for the same location at the same time.

#### LineReal

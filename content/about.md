I worked for years as a marketeer and business owner. Then wanted to make a website the exact way I envision it and became obsessed with learning web development. Years later I became a competent web developer that has a strong foundation in business and marketing.
I have the skill set to combine both business and marketing skills with web development. My current preferred tools are Laravel for creating the backend API and nuxt/vue.js for the front end. My main languages are PHP and Javascript.

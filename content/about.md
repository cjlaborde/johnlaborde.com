I worked for years as a marketeer and business owner. Then wanted to make a website the exact way I envision it and became obsessed with learning web development. Years latter I became a competent web developer than has a strong foundation in business and marketing.
I have the skill set to combine both business and marketing skills.

A “technical marketer” is an advertising executive with knowledge and skills that extend far beyond coming up with clever logos and commercials. They know how to code, build scripts, work with APIs and manipulate statistical data. They can automate sales processes and discover trends in customer behavior.

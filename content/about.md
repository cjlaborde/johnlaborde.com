I worked for years as a marketeer and business owner. Then wanted to make a website the exact way I envision it and became obsessed with learning web development. Years latter I became a competent web developer than has a strong foundation in business and marketing.
I have the skill set to combine both business and marketing skills. My current prefered tools are laravel for creating the backend api and nuxt/vue.js for the front end. My main languages are php and javascript. I do my development using docker.
